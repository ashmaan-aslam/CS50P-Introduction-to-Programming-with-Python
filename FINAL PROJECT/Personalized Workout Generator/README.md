#### Description: FitPlan is an interactive Python-based application designed to help users generate customized workout plans based on their individual fitness preferences. It caters to users seeking to enhance their fitness routine by offering tailored workout options, accommodating different workout types, difficulty levels, and durations. FitPlan also allows users to save and revisit their workout plans, making it a flexible and practical tool for staying on track with fitness goals.
FitPlan is a Python-based program that generates personalized workout plans tailored to user preferences. Users can select from three workout types—Cardio, Strength, or Flexibility—and choose their preferred difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) as well as the workout duration in minutes.

Once the plan is generated, users can view it, save it to a file (saved_workout.json), or load previously saved plans. The application also incorporates robust input validation and error handling, making it user-friendly and reliable. It ensures smooth operation even if files are missing or user inputs are incorrect.
FitPlan begins by loading exercise data from a text file, categorizing each exercise by type, difficulty, and duration. Users are greeted with a menu offering three options: create a new workout plan, load a saved plan, or exit the program. If creating a new plan, the user specifies their workout preferences, and the program filters exercises that meet these criteria. It then generates a plan by randomly selecting exercises until the desired duration is met. The plan is displayed in an organized format, and users have the option to save it for future use. Saved plans can be loaded and viewed at any time. The program seamlessly manages file operations and validates all user inputs to ensure an
